# üÉèMiniShell :

**                    **The objective of this project is for you to¬†create a simple shell !!**

**With Minishell, you'll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn't exist.**

- ***`what is minishell ?`***
    
    *A minishell is a small-scale implementation of a command-line shell, written in C . It provides a basic set of shell functionalities such as executing commands, managing processes, and manipulating files and directories. Unlike a full-fledged Unix shell like bash, zsh or fish, a minishell does not have all the advanced features such as scripting, command substitution, and complex configuration options.*
    
    *A minishell typically implements a subset of the Unix shell syntax and commands. It provides a command prompt where the user can type commands, which are then parsed and executed by the minishell. The basic workflow of a minishell involves reading user input, parsing the input to identify the command and its arguments, and then executing the command using one of the **`exec()`** family of functions.*
    
    *A minishell also typically provides some basic built-in commands such as **`cd`**, **`exit`**, and **`echo`**, which are implemented directly in the minishell code rather than being separate programs. Additionally, a minishell may implement basic features such as command history, job control, and command line editing.*
    
    *Overall, a minishell provides a lightweight and simplified version of a Unix shell that can be useful for learning programming or for situations where a full-featured shell is not needed*
    
- ***`what is shell ?`***
    
    *A shell is a type of computer program called a command-line interpreter that lets Linux and Unix users control their operating systems with command-line interfaces. Shells allow users to communicate efficiently and directly with their operating systems*
    
- ***`available functions :`***
    - üìã¬†functions :
        - ***The GNU Readline Library ‚Äú*`readline/readline.h‚Äù`**
            - $**readline$ :**  *read a line from the terminal and return it / Receives a string, stores it, and returns a memory address, Since it is allocated by malloc, it must be freed.*
            
            ```c
            #include <readline/readline.h>
            
            char *readline(const char *str)
            ```
            
            - ***rl_clear_history** : When you use the **`readline`** function to read input from the user, the library automatically maintains a history of previous commands entered by the user. The **`rl_clear_history`** function allows you to clear this history so that previous commands will no longer be available for recall.*
            
            ```c
            #include <readline/history.h>
            
             void rl_clear_history(void);
            ```
            
            - ***rl_on_new_line*** : *When you use the **`readline`** function to read input from the user, the library automatically handles moving the cursor to the next line when the user presses enter to submit their input. However, in some cases, you may want to explicitly move to a new line before displaying the next prompt. This is where the **`rl_on_new_line`**
             function comes in*
            
            ```c
            int		 rl_on_new_line(void);
            ```
            
            - ***rl_replace_line*** : When you use the **`readline`** function to read input from the user, the library stores the input as a string in a buffer. The **`rl_replace_line`**  function allows you to replace this buffer with a new string.
            
            ```c
            void		 rl_replace_line(char *str, int clear_undo);
            ```
            
            *The first argument **`text`** is a pointer to the new string you want to replace the current input line with.*
            
             *The second argument **`clear_undo`** is a flag that tells the library whether or not to clear the undo history for the current line.*
            
            > *If you set **`clear_undo`** to a non-zero value, the library will clear the undo history for the current line. This means that the user won't be able to use the **`Ctrl+_`**
             or **`Ctrl+U`** key combinations to undo changes to the current line.*
            > 
            
            <aside>
            üí° *`Ctrl+_ and Ctrl+U are keyboard shortcuts that are often used in Unix-like operating systems.`*
            
            *`Ctrl+_ is typically used to undo changes to the current line in a terminal emulator. When you press Ctrl+_, the terminal emulator sends the SIGQUIT signal to the current process. If the process is running the libreadline library and has enabled the undo functionality, libreadline will undo the most recent change to the current line.`*
            
            *`Ctrl+U is typically used to clear the current line in a terminal emulator. When you press Ctrl+U, the terminal emulator sends the SIGINT signal to the current process. If the process is running the libreadline library, libreadline will clear the current input line.`*
            
            *`Note that the behavior of Ctrl+_ and Ctrl+U may vary depending on the terminal emulator and the configuration of the system.`*
            
            </aside>
            
            - **rl_redisplay** : *When you call **`rl_redisplay`**, the library updates the display of the current input line to reflect any changes that have been made since the line was first displayed. This can be useful if you want to update the display of the input line without replacing the entire line using **`rl_replace_line`**.*
                
                ```c
                void		 rl_redisplay(void);
                ```
                
            - ***add_history* :** *When you call **`add_history`** , the library adds a copy of the current input line to the history list, which can be accessed later using the up and down arrow keys. This is similar to the command history feature in many shells and other command-line interfaces.*
            
            ```c
            #include <readline/history.h>
            
            add_history(const char *str)
            ```
            
            <aside>
            üí° `**To compile a program that uses the libreadline library in C, you need to include the library in the compilation command.**`
            
            `**Here's an example of how to compile a program that uses libreadline:**`
            
            ```bash
            gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lreadline
            ```
            
            `**In this example, my_program is the name of the executable file you want to create, and my_program.c is the name of the C file that contains your program code.**`
            
            `**The -lreadline flag tells the compiler to link the libreadline library to your program. When you include this flag, the compiler will look for the libreadline library and add it to the compilation command.**`
            
            `**Make sure you have installed the libreadline library on your system before trying to compile your program. If you are using a Linux-based system, you can install the library using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the libreadline-dev package by running:**`
            
            ```bash
            sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev
            ```
            
            `**Once you have installed the library and compiled your program with the -lreadline flag, you should be able to run the program and use the libreadline functions in your code.**`

                ```
                
                *The function takes two arguments:*
                
                1. **`*pathname`**: A pointer to a string that contains the path to the file or directory to be checked.*
                2. **`*mode`**: An integer that specifies the type of access to be checked, and can take one of the following values:*
                    - **`*F_OK`**: Check for the existence of the file.*
                    - **`*R_OK`**: Check for read permission.*
                    - **`*W_OK`**: Check for write permission.*
                    - **`*X_OK`**: Check for execute permission.*
                
                *The function returns **`0`** if the access is allowed, or **`-1`** if it is not allowed or if an error occurs.*
                
            
            - $**open$ :** *function is used to open a file or create it if it does not exist.*
                
                ```c
                #include <sys/types.h>

                ```
                
                *The function takes two or three arguments:*
                
                1. **`*pathname`**: A pointer to a string that contains the path to the file to be opened or created.*
                2. **`*flags`**: An integer that specifies the mode in which the file is to be opened. It can be one or a combination of the following flags:*
                    - **`*O_RDONLY`**: Open the file in read-only mode.*
                    - **`*O_WRONLY`**: Open the file in write-only mode.*
                    - **`*O_RDWR`**: Open the file in read-write mode.*
                    - **`*O_APPEND`**: Append to the end of the file on each write.*
                    - **`*O_CREAT`**: Create the file if it does not exist.*
                    - **`*O_TRUNC`**: Truncate the file to zero length if it already exists.*
                    - **`*O_EXCL`**: When used with **`O_CREAT`**, ensure that the file is newly created and return an error if it already exists.*
                3. **`*mode`** (optional): An integer that specifies the permissions to be set on the file if it is created. It is only used when the **`O_CREAT`** flag is present. The value should be specified in octal notation, and can be combined with one or more of the following permission flags:*
                    - **`*S_IRUSR`**: Read permission for the owner.*
                    - **`*S_IWUSR`**: Write permission for the owner.*
                    - **`*S_IXUSR`**: Execute permission for the owner.*
                    - **`*S_IRGRP`**: Read permission for the group.*
                    - **`*S_IWGRP`**: Write permission for the group.*
                    - **`*S_IXGRP`**: Execute permission for the group.*
                    - **`*S_IROTH`**: Read permission for others.*
                    - **`*S_IWOTH`**: Write permission for others.*
                    - **`*S_IXOTH`**: Execute permission for others.*
                    
                    *The function returns a file descriptor, which is a small non-negative integer that is used to refer to the open file in subsequent operations. If an error occurs, the function returns -1*
                    
            - $**read**$ *: is a function in the C programming language that reads data from a file descriptor .*
                
                ```c
                #include <unistd.h>
                ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
                ```
                
                ```c
                #include <unistd.h>
                
                ssize_t pread(int fd, void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset)
                ```
                
                **`*read`** is a function in the C programming language that reads data from a file descriptor. It takes four arguments:*
                
                1. **`*fd`**: The file descriptor from which to read.*
                2. **`*buf`**: A pointer to the buffer that will hold the data read from the file.*
                3. **`*count`**: The maximum number of bytes to read.*
                4. **`*offset`**: The offset in the file at which to start reading.*
                
                *The **`read`** function returns the number of bytes read from the file, or -1 if an error occurs. It is often used in conjunction with the **`open`** function to read data from a file.*
                
                <aside>
                üí° The **`offset`** parameter in the **`read`** function specifies the position within the file to start reading data from. This parameter is an integer value that represents the number of bytes from the beginning of the file to start reading data from.
                
                For example, if you set the **`offset`** to 0, **`read`** will start reading data from the beginning of the file. If you set the **`offset`** to 10, **`read`** will start reading data from the 11th byte of the file.
                
                Note that the **`offset`** parameter is not always used in every call to **`read`**. In many cases, you can simply pass 0 for the **`offset`** parameter to read from the current position in the file.

            - $**close$ :** *function is used to close an open file or socket .*
                
                ```c
                #include <unistd.h>
                
                int close(int fd);
                ```
                
                *The **`close`** function returns 0 if the file is closed successfully, and -1 if there is an error. Some common errors include passing an invalid file descriptor, or trying to close a file that is already closed.*
                
                *It's important to note that after calling the **`close`** function, the file descriptor is no longer valid and should not be used again. Attempting to read from or write to a closed file descriptor can lead to undefined behavior*

                The **`ttyname`** function takes an integer file descriptor **`fd`** as its argument and returns a pointer to a string containing the name of the terminal device associated with that file descriptor. If **`fd`** is not a valid file descriptor or is not associated with a terminal device, the function returns a null pointer.
                
                The **`ttyname`** function is typically used to determine the name of the terminal device associated with standard input, output, or error streams, which have file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The name of the terminal device can be useful for various purposes, such as for sending output sequences or for determining the terminal's capabilities.

                The **`isatty`** function takes an integer file descriptor **`fd`** as its argument and returns a non-zero integer value if the file descriptor refers to a terminal device, or zero if it does not.
                
                The **`isatty`** function is often used to test whether standard input, output, or error streams (which have file descriptors 0, 1, and 2, respectively) are associated with terminal devices. If the function returns a non-zero value, it indicates that the corresponding stream is a terminal device and can be used for interactive I/O operations.

                - **`size`**: an unsigned integer value that specifies the size in bytes of the memory block to allocate.
                
                The **`malloc`** function returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block, or a **`NULL`** pointer if the allocation fails.
                
                The allocated memory block is not initialized and may contain arbitrary values. To initialize the memory block to a specific value, you can use the **`memset`** function, which is also part of the **`string.h`** library.

                The **`free`** function does not return a value.
                
                It's important to note that the pointer passed to **`free`** must point to a valid memory block that was previously allocated with **`malloc`**, **`calloc`**, or **`realloc`**. If the pointer is invalid, or if the memory block has already been deallocated, the behavior of the **`free`** function is undefined and may lead to errors or crashes.

                `sig`: an integer value that specifies the signal to handle.
                `handler:` a pointer to a function that will be called when the signal is received.
                The signal function returns a pointer to the previous signal handler, or SIG_ERR if an error occurs.
                
                When a signal is received, the specified handler function is called with an integer argument that specifies the signal number. The handler function can perform any necessary action, such as cleaning up resources, setting flags, or taking some other action in response to the signal

                - **`signum`**: an integer value that specifies the signal to handle.
                - **`act`**: a pointer to a **`sigaction`** structure that specifies the new signal handler to install.
                - **`oldact`**: a pointer to a **`sigaction`** structure that will receive the previous signal handler.

            - **`set`**: a pointer to a **`sigset_t`** structure that represents the signal set to be initialized.
            
            The **`sigemptyset`** function returns **`0`** on success, or **`-1`** on error.
            
            The **`sigset_t`** structure is used to represent a set of signals. The **`sigemptyset`** function initializes the signal set to be empty, so that it does not contain any signals.
            
            After initializing a signal set with **`sigemptyset`**, you can add individual signals to the set using the **`sigaddset`** function, or you can use a convenience function like **`sigfillset`** to initialize the set to contain all signals.

If **`pid`** is positive, the signal is sent to the process with the specified ID. If **`pid`** is negative, the signal is sent to the process group with the absolute value of **`pid`**. If **`pid`** is zero, the signal is sent to all processes in the current process group.
                - **`sig`**: an integer value that specifies the signal to send.
                
                The **`kill`** function returns **`0`** on success, or **`-1`** on error.
                
                The **`sig`** argument specifies the signal to send to the specified process or process group. Some common signals include **`SIGTERM`** (terminate), **`SIGINT`** (interrupt), **`SIGKILL`** (kill), and **`SIGSTOP`** (stop). You can also define your own signals using the **`signal`** function.
                
                <aside>
                üí° The **`kill`** function can be useful for controlling other processes from your own program, such as sending signals to terminate a process, interrupt a process, or communicate with a process. However, it's important to use caution when sending signals, as they can cause unintended consequences if not used carefully.

            - $exit :$ function is used to terminate the current process.
            
            ```c
            void exit(int status);
            ```
            
            The **`exit`** function takes one argument:
            
            - **`status`**: an integer value that specifies the exit status of the process. A zero value usually indicates successful completion, while a nonzero value indicates an error.
            
            The **`exit`** function does not return a value.
            
            When you call the **`exit`** function, the current process is terminated and all open files are closed. The exit status is then returned to the parent process or shell that launched the program.
            
            You can use the exit status to communicate information about the success or failure of the program to the parent process. For example, a shell script can check the exit status of a program to determine whether it succeeded or failed, and take appropriate action based on that result.
            
        
        <aside>
        üí° It's worth noting that the **`exit`**
         function should be used with care, as terminating a process abruptly can cause unintended consequences. You should ensure that any necessary cleanup or resource deallocation is performed before calling **`exit`**.

    *To start the execution of a command in Minishell, you first need to parse the user input and convert it into tokens that can be executed by the shell. This involves breaking down the user input into individual words or commands, handling escape characters and quotes, and tokenizing the input.*
    
    *Once you have parsed the user input into tokens, you can then execute the command. The exact steps for executing a command will depend on whether it is a built-in command or an external command.*
    
    *For built-in commands, you can simply call the appropriate function within the shell program to perform the desired action. For example, if the user enters the "cd" command to change the current working directory, you can call a function in your shell program that changes the current working directory using the chdir() system call.*
    
    *For external commands, you need to create a child process to run the command. You can use the fork() system call to create a child process, and then use one of the exec() system calls to replace the child process with the desired command. This will allow the child process to execute the command and then exit, returning control to the parent process.*
    
    *If the user input includes a pipeline or other shell feature, you will need to handle this as well. For pipelines, you can create multiple child processes and set up pipes to connect the output of one command to the input of the next command. For other shell features, you may need to handle input/output redirection, environment variables, and shell expansion.*
    
    *Overall, the key to starting execution in Minishell is to have a clear understanding of the user input, the desired command, and how to execute it in the context of the shell program.*

                    1. *Exit with a specific status code: The `exit` command can be used to exit with a specific status code, which can be checked by other programs or scripts that invoke the Bash shell. For example, the command `exit 1` will exit the shell with a status code of 1, indicating that an error occurred.*
                    2. *Exit a loop or function: The `exit` command can also be used to exit a loop or function early. For example, in a `for` loop, the `exit` command can be used to exit the loop early if a certain condition is met.*
                    3. *Terminate a script: When writing Bash scripts, the `exit` command is often used at the end of the script to terminate the session. This ensures that any resources or processes created by the script are properly cleaned up and that the shell returns control to the parent process.*
                    4. *Interrupt a long-running process: If a Bash script is running a long-running process, such as a database query or file download, the `exit` command can be used to interrupt the process and terminate the session. This is often used when a user needs to cancel a running script or command.*
                    5. *Exit a subshell: If a Bash script spawns a subshell, such as a new terminal window, the `exit` command can be used to exit the subshell and return control to the parent process.*

This can be useful if we need to share information between different scripts or programs.*
                    2. *Setting system-wide defaults: Environment variables can be used to set system-wide defaults that affect the behavior of all programs and scripts. For example, the **`PATH`** environment variable is used to specify the directories where the system should look for executable files.*
                    3. *Managing user preferences: Environment variables can also be used to manage user preferences that affect the behavior of individual programs or scripts. For example, a user might define an environment variable named **`EDITOR`** to specify the default text editor to use for editing files.*
                    4. *Overriding default settings: Environment variables can be used to override default settings for individual programs or scripts. For example, a user might set an environment variable named **`PS1`** to change the prompt that is displayed by the Bash shell.*
                    
                    *In summary, the **`export`** command is used to create environment variables, which are variables that are made available to child processes of the current shell and to other programs and scripts running on the system.

                    The **`unset`** command is used to remove a variable or function from the current shell environment. There are several reasons why you might need to use **`unset`**:
                    
                    1. Remove unnecessary or obsolete variables: Over time, your shell environment may accumulate variables that are no longer needed or have become obsolete. These variables can clutter your environment and make it harder to find the variables that are actually important. Using **`unset`** to remove these variables can help keep your environment clean and organized.
                    2. Avoid conflicts: Sometimes, two or more variables can have the same name but different values. This can cause confusion and unexpected behavior in scripts and other programs that rely on these variables. By using **`unset`** to remove unwanted variables, you can avoid these conflicts and ensure that your scripts and programs work as expected.
                    3. Protect sensitive information: In some cases, you may have variables that contain sensitive information, such as passwords or access keys. Using **`unset`** to remove these variables when they are no longer needed can help protect this information from being accidentally leaked or disclosed.
                    4. Debugging: When you are debugging a script or program, you may need to remove a variable temporarily to test different scenarios or troubleshoot issues. The **`unset`** command can be useful in this situation.
                    
                    In summary, the **`unset`** command is a useful tool for managing your shell environment, avoiding conflicts, protecting sensitive information, and debugging scripts and programs.

                    üí° An obsolete variable is a variable that is no longer needed or relevant in the current shell environment. Obsolete variables can accumulate over time as a result of changes in the system or changes in user preferences.
                    
                    For example, an obsolete variable might be one that was used to configure an application that is no longer installed on your system. Another example could be a variable that was used to control an aspect of the system that has since been deprecated or removed.
                    
                    Obsolete variables can clutter your shell environment and make it harder to find the variables that are actually important. They can also cause conflicts with other variables or lead to unexpected behavior in scripts and programs.
                    
                    It's a good practice to periodically review the variables in your shell environment and remove any that are obsolete. The **`unset`** command can be used to remove obsolete variables and keep your environment clean and organized.
